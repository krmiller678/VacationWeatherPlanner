/*
The main function is where we will run any GUI applications, request input files from the user, and output
the following results at the users request:
1. The average temp on a specific date for a City
2. The average temp on the week of a date for a City (the week beginning with .......)
3. The average temp on a specific date for all Cities
4. The average temp on the week of a date for all Cities (the week beginning with .......)

In addition, when uploading the data we give the user feedback on how long the data took to:
- store and organize in our std::unordered_map vs std::priority_queue
- retrieve data based on their selection preference (find in map vs heap)
